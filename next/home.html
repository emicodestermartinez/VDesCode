    <h2>
      Hey babe,
    </h2>
    <p>It has been 678 days 5 hours and 20 mins since we first met when you're reading this. It's the second
      Valentines<br>
      Day we're going <br>
      to hopefully celebrate <br>
      Honestly it has been a hell of a roller coaster and we've both gone through alot and I don't know if you still<br>
      wanna be with me <br>
      but I just wanna let you know that deep down I still love you, nothing has changed and my heart still aches for
      <br>
      you. I still love <br>
      the same like I used to when we first met... <br>
      I keep reminiscing about the good ol' times when we'd talk all night , I miss those nights when we used to have
      <br>
      fun together, when you'd give me your sweet hugs and hold me tight <br>
      I miss those moments alot and I keep staring at your pics all day hoping that one day everything will get fixed
      <br>
      I hope you're doing good and are alright while reading this , all I have ever wanted is to see you happy <br>
      And always keep your beautiful smileee on your beautiful face! <br>
      You might find this funny but Whenever I look at the moon or watch the sunrise, it reminds me about you... <br>
      <b>Because you're my sunshine and the only one who took me out of darkness and showed me light!</b>

      And the future is so unpredictable<br>
      But just hold on like you'll never let go<br>

      To make her smile<br>
      Cant ignore the way she showed me light<br>
      In this darkness<br>
      <br>
      Have been betrayed and cheated<br>
      But she was someone different<br>
      Those beautiful moments were just so good<br>
      Never knew can get a frnd this amazing<br>
      Until i met her, oh yeah<br>
      <br>
      Its been rlly dead lately<br>
      As someone whom i loved left me<br>
      All i had was dying in pain<br>
      Until met her<br>

      She gave me hope<br>
      Taught me how to be happy<br>
      Today my nights are still hollow<br>

      Traveling through this road of thorns<br>
      In search of a place unknown<br>

      Traveled all over the word<br>
      But it felt just running around<br>
